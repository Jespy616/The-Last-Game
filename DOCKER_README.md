# **Docker Setup and Usage Guide**

## **Introduction**
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for installing, configuring, and running Docker for our project. It includes details on using Docker via command line and Docker Desktop.

---

## **1. Installing Docker**
### **Windows & macOS**
1. Download and install **Docker Desktop** from [Docker's official site](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
2. Ensure that **WSL 2** is installed (Windows users will be prompted to install it).
3. Restart your computer after installation.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and verify installation:
   ```sh
   docker --version
   ```
   Expected output (version may vary):
   ```sh
   Docker version 24.0.2, build cb74dfc
   ```

### **Linux** 
1.  Update your system and install Docker Compose (if needed):
      ```sh
      sudo apt update
      sudo apt install docker-compose
      ```
      Note: This installs Docker Compose, but Docker Engine should already be installed or installed separately. If Docker is not installed, install it using your distro's package manager or via Docker's official repository.
   
2. Start Docker and enable it to launch on boot:
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl start docker
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   ```
3.  (Optional) Add your user to the Docker group (to run Docker without sudo):

      a. Check if the docker group exists:
      ```sh
      getent group docker
      ```
      b. Add your user to the Docker group:

      ```sh
      sudo usermod G docker -a $USER
      ```
      c. Apply the group change without logging out:
      ```sh
      newgrp docker
      ```
      d. Verify the change:
      ```sh
      groups
      ```
      ‚ö†Ô∏è You may need to restart your terminal session or log out and back in for the group change to take full effect.

4. Verify Docker installation:
      ```sh
      docker --version
      docker compose version  # optional, to verify Docker Compose
      ```

## **2. Running and Managing Containers via Command Line**
1. Create or ensure you have a **`.env` file** in the project root (in the same folder as the docker-compose.yml file) with necessary environment variables. Docker uses one central `.env` file for secret keys and passwords. This file will not be provided in the image or on git, so you will need to create the `.env` file locally. Contact Team NaN for more information.
3. Build and start Docker services:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build 
   ```
   - `--build`: Rebuilds the images if changes were made.

   
    This will start the three containers in this Docker project, namely backend, frontend, and game_db (database). **You do not need to install anything like Go, Postgres, Svelte, or any other software to run the code.** Docker will do all that for you. 
4. Check running containers:
   ```sh
   docker ps
   ```


4. Stops and removes all running containers. Do this after you finish your coding sessions.
    ```sh
    docker-compose down
    ```


### **Restarting Containers**
```sh
docker-compose restart
```
Restarts all containers.

### **Viewing Container Logs**
```sh
docker-compose logs -f backend
```
Shows real-time logs for a specific container (e.g., `backend`).

### **Accessing a Running Container‚Äôs Shell**
```sh
docker exec -it backend sh
```
Opens a shell session inside the `backend` container.

## **4. Using Docker Desktop**
### **Starting & Stopping Services**
1. Open **Docker Desktop**.
2. Navigate to the **Containers** tab.
3. Start or stop services by clicking the play/stop buttons.

### **Checking Logs**
1. Click on a running container.
2. Navigate to the **Logs** tab.

### **Accessing a Running Container‚Äôs Shell**
1. Click on a running container
2. Navigate to the **Exec** tab to access a shell inside that container. This allows for better testing of that particular shell. For example, you could run the command to display environment variables to see if they transfered through from your .env file.

## **5. Cleaning Up Docker**
### **Remove Unused Containers & Images**
```sh
docker system prune -a
```
This removes all unused containers, images, and networks to free up space.



## **Conclusion**
Following these steps will ensure a smooth Docker setup for our project. If you run into any issues, feel free to ask Team NaN for help. üöÄ
