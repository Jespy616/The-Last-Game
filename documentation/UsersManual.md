# Overview of the Software 
Our AI-driven video game leverages procedural generation and AI-controlled decision-making to create unique, dynamic gameplay experiences for each player. By incorporating advanced AI, the game will:

- Generate dynamic storylines, dungeons, and interactions based on player choices.
- Utilize AI-driven enemies that adapt to player behavior and tactics.
- Provide real-time difficulty adjustments based on player performance.

This approach ensures a fresh and engaging experience every time a player starts a new session, increasing replayability and engagement.

# Getting Started

Fill out the following fields:
- `Username`
- `Email`
- `Password`
- `Confirm Password`

Note that the `password` must be 6 characters or more and the `confirm password` should match what is in the `password` field.
Finally, check the box next to `Accept terms & conditions` and click `create account` to create your account.

## Sign in
1. Enter your username and password in the appropriate fields
2. (Optional) click `remember me`
3. Click the `LOGIN` button

You will be redirected to a page that give you an option to [start a new game](#starting-a-new-game)  

## Starting a new game
After logging in, you will be taken to the menu screen with a button that says `start game`. Clicking this button will bring you to to a screen that explains the game. Click `next` in the bottom right to continue.

You will then be given a couple of options for your game:
- Theme - this affects the aesthetic of the map
- Difficulty - this affects the overall stats of the enemies

After selecting your options, the AI will generate a story, floor, enemies, and weapons. While this process is usually quick, there are some cases where it may take a long time. See the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section for more details if you encounter this.
