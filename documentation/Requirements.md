### In-Depth Descriptions
Note: Some of the descriptions were written by the author and then used by ChatGPT to apply proper and more clear langauge.

### Save/Load States
The game must include a robust save and load system to allow players to preserve their progress. Key details include:
1. **Auto-Save Triggers:** The game will auto-save after key events:
   - Opening a chest.
   - Before entering a boss fight.
   - When transitioning to a new floor.
2. **Manual Saves:** Players can manually save their progress from the menu, except during boss fights.
3. **Save Data Contents:** The following data will be stored:
   - Player stats (health, attack, defense, abilities, inventory).
   - Current floor.
   - Room progression (e.g., enemies defeated, bosses defeated, chests opened).
   - Player’s remaining lives.
4. **Single Save File:** Saves overwrite a single file, ensuring simplicity and avoiding confusion.

### Login/Register
Players must have the option to create and access accounts. This functionality will allow:
1. **Progress Tracking:** Saved progress tied to player accounts.
2. **In-Game Purchases:** The ability to retain purchases linked to the account.
3. **Implementation Notes:** This feature will require:
   - Basic username/password creation.
   - Account storage in an online database.

### Turn-Based Player Movement
Players will navigate the dungeon in discrete turns. Each turn allows for one action:
- **Move (Up-Down-Left-Right):** Players use arrow keys to move through the dungeon grid.
- **Attack:** Pressing the `SPACE` key will execute a basic attack against an adjacent enemy in the direction the player is facing.
- **Block/Heal:** The `SHIFT` key will allow players to resist all incoming damage for one turn. If there are no incoming attacks while the player is blocking, the player will heal for 5% of their max Health.
- **Abilities:** Special abilities (triggered by the `R` key) can heal, inflict status effects, or deal damage.

### Turn-Based Enemy Behavior
Enemies act in response to player movements. Enemy behavior includes:
1. **Pathfinding:** Enemies navigate toward the player, avoiding obstacles such as walls and chests.
2. **Attack:** Enemies attack the player if within range.
3. **Heal:** Enemies can self-heal under specific conditions:
   - Enemy health is below 50%.
   - Enemy is farther than one tile from the player.
   - The player has more health than the enemy.
4. **Turn Priority:** Enemies act based on their position in the grid, processed from top-left to bottom-right.

### Player Stats
Players’ progression is represented by their stats, which improve as they level up:
- **Attack:** Increases damage output.
- **Defense:** Reduces incoming damage.
- **Health:** Determines the player’s survivability.

### Damage Calculation
Damage is calculated using the following formulas:
- **Player Attack:** `Base Weapon Damage + (Base Weapon Damage x 0.05 x Player Attack)`.
- **Enemy Attack:** Enemies will use similar formulas but with their respective stats.
- **Defense Reduction:** `Damage Taken = Incoming Damage - (Incoming Damage x 0.95 x Defense Stat)`.

### Tutorial
An in-depth, hardcoded tutorial will be provided as an optional feature. Key aspects:
1. **Content:** Covers basic movement, interaction with elements (e.g., chests, enemies), and combat mechanics.
2. **Replayability:** Players can replay the tutorial via the settings menu.
3. **Design:** A simple 2-room floor with a chest room and stair room to familiarize players with core mechanics.

### Interactable Elements

#### Enemies
Enemies act as obstacles, challenging the player’s progress. Key traits:
1. **Spawn Behavior:**
   - Enemies spawn when a player enters a room.
   - They remain until defeated or the player leaves the floor.
2. **Movement:** Enemies pursue the player within the room but do not follow into new rooms.
3. **Combat:** Enemies can attack, block, or heal as described in their behavior.

#### Chests
Chests provide rewards and motivate exploration. Details:
1. **Spawn Conditions:** Appear in cleared Chest Rooms.
2. **Loot Table:**
   - **Weapons/Equipment:** Common (20%), Uncommon (12%), Rare (9%), Legendary (6%), Mythic (3%).
   - **EXP Boosts:** Small (15%), Medium (10%), Large (5%).
   - **Abilities:** 20% chance.
3. **Contents Scaling:** Loot quality improves with floor level and [floor difficulty](#difficulty-choice).

1. **Room Requirements:**
   - At least 10 rooms.
   - Includes 1 Stair Room, 3 Chest Rooms, and randomized Normal, Hallway, and Trap Rooms.
2. **Special Room Rates:**
   - Stair Room: Exactly 1 per floor.
   - Chest Room: Guaranteed 3 per floor, then 10% chance for additional ones.
   - Hallway Room: 20% chance.
   - Trap Room: 3% chance.

#### Room Contents
Enemy spawns and room types are randomized. Room types include:
- **Normal Room:** Basic rectangular room with up to 4 doors.
- **Stair Room:** Contains stairs to the next floor after clearing enemies.
- **Chest Room:** Rewards a chest upon clearing enemies.
- **Hallway Room:** Long, narrow pathways with no enemies.
- **Trap Room:** Spawns additional enemies after clearing those that initially spawn.

#### Items
Randomized items include:
1. **Rarity:** Common, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary, Mythic.
2. **Attributes:** Name, damage, type (AoE, Ranged, Melee), and rarity.
3. **Scaling:** Higher rarity items provide better stats and effects.

#### Bosses and Enemies
Generated attributes include:
- **Name:** Unique identifiers.
- **Health:** Determines durability.
- **Defense:** Mitigates damage taken.
- **Attack:** Influences offensive capability.
- **Dialogue:** Key enemies or bosses may include dialogue to tie into story arcs.

### Sprites
Sprites visually represent characters, enemies, and environments. AI-generated sprites should align with the dungeon’s story or theme.

### Difficulty Choice
At the start of each floor, players choose from three difficulty levels:
1. **Easy:** Lower enemy stats and lower rate of spawn for rare loot.
2. **Medium:** Balanced difficulty and loot rates.
3. **Expert:** Stronger enemies, higher chances for rare loot, and increased experience gain.

To incentivize harder paths, rare item drop rates increase with difficulty. Easier paths provide weaker items and slower stat scaling.

### **Difficulty Rise**
As players progress through levels or dungeons, the game becomes increasingly challenging. This difficulty adjustment can include stronger enemies with enhanced health, attack power, and new abilities. Additionally, puzzles will grow in complexity, requiring more thought and skill to solve as the game unfolds. This ensures a steady learning curve and keeps gameplay engaging.

---

### **Story**
The AI will dynamically generate a story tailored to the player’s preferences. During the initial setup, the player provides input on the type of game they want to experience (e.g., fantasy, sci-fi, western). The AI then creates a narrative that immerses the player in a unique, personalized story, making their decisions and actions integral to its progression.

---

### **Non-Player Characters (NPCs)**
NPCs will populate the game world, each serving a distinct purpose:
- **Story progression**: Through engaging dialogue, NPCs will guide players and reveal parts of the story.
- **Gameplay assistance**: NPCs can offer support, such as healing, offering advice, or granting buffs.
- **Merchants**: NPCs provide opportunities to buy, sell, and trade items essential for survival or progression.

---

### **Experience and Leveling**
Players earn experience (XP) through defeating enemies, solving puzzles, and completing objectives. As they level up, they unlock new abilities, improve stats, and gain access to advanced weapons or tools. This progression system keeps gameplay fresh and rewarding.

---

### **AI-Generated Sprites**
The AI will design character and environmental sprites that align with the game’s theme. For example:
- A western-themed game will feature cowboys, saloons, and desert landscapes.
- A fantasy setting might include knights, dragons, and enchanted forests.
This ensures a cohesive aesthetic tailored to the player’s preferences.

---

### **Sound Effects**
Sound design enhances immersion by providing audio cues for various actions and events. Key sound effects include:
- Footsteps (movement)
- Opening chests
- Running into walls
- Attacking enemies
- Taking or blocking damage
- Using abilities
- Dialogue exchanges
- Enemy defeat
- Player death
- Gaining experience or leveling up
- Taking stairs or transitioning levels

---

### **In-Game Feedback**
Periodically, the AI will prompt players for feedback on their gaming experience. Based on this feedback, it can adjust gameplay elements like difficulty, pacing, or story focus, ensuring the experience remains enjoyable and tailored to the player.

---

### **AI Pre-Play Chat**
Before gameplay begins, players interact with the AI to design their ideal game. The AI asks questions about their preferred genre, difficulty, game length, and desired features, using the responses to craft a personalized game world.

---

### **Player Choice Impact**
Choices matter. Players will be presented with decisions throughout the game, influencing the story, character relationships, and the game world. For example:
- Helping an NPC might lead to new allies.
- Ignoring a quest could result in harsher challenges later.

---

### **Evolving Narrative**
The AI continuously adapts the story based on the player’s behavior and decisions. For instance:
- If a player consistently steals from NPCs, the AI might turn them into a wanted criminal, altering how NPCs interact with them.
- Heroic deeds might lead to rewards, fame, or even new allies.

---


### **Music**
Dynamic music enhances the atmosphere and immerses the player in the story. The AI can adjust tracks based on the situation (e.g., intense battle themes or soothing exploration melodies) and the player’s chosen game genre.

---

### **Inventory**
A functional inventory system allows players to store and manage items, such as:
- Weapons
- Healing items
- Quest-related objects
The system ensures players have the tools needed to adapt to challenges.

---

### **Status Effects**
Temporary buffs or debuffs add depth to gameplay, affecting players and enemies alike. Examples include:
- **Poison**: Gradual health loss over time.
- **Paralysis**: Temporary inability to act.
- **Regeneration**: Slow recovery of health or mana.

---

### **Critical Hits**
A chance-based mechanic where attacks deal significantly increased damage, adding excitement and unpredictability to combat. The AI could dynamically adjust critical hit rates for balance.

---

### **Mini-Map**
A simplified map displays explored areas of the dungeon and the player’s current location. This helps with navigation while maintaining a sense of discovery.

---

### **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA)**
The AI monitors player performance and adjusts the difficulty in real-time. Examples include:
- Increasing enemy health if battles are too easy.
- Adding hints or simplifying puzzles if players are struggling.
