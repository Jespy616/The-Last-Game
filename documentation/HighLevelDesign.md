## 3. Architecture Design

### Overview

This project follows a **client-server architecture**. The **client** interacts with the game through a **web-based application**, which handles rendering, user input, and game mechanics. The **server** manages authentication, game state persistence, AI-generated content, and procedural logic. The **database** stores user data, game progress, and dynamically generated content.

The architecture is designed for **scalability and modularity**, ensuring that different components can be improved or replaced without affecting the overall system.

---

### Component Diagram

The following table represents the **high-level architecture** of the system, outlining the responsibilities of each component and how they interact.

#### **System Architecture Overview**
| **Component**        | **Technology**         | **Responsibilities** |
|----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| **Frontend**         | Svelte + Phaser.js    | - Handles UI & game rendering  |
|                      |                       | - Manages player movement & interactions  |
|                      |                       | - Processes game logic & turn-based mechanics |
|                      |                       | - Calls API endpoints for AI generation  |
| **Backend**          | Go (Gin Framework)    | - Handles authentication & user management  |
|                      |                       | - Implements AI procedural generation  |
|                      |                       | - Provides API endpoints for game state management |
| **Database**         | PostgreSQL            | - Stores user accounts & authentication data |
|                      |                       | - Saves game progress & AI-generated content |
|                      |                       | - Manages inventory, items, and player stats |

#### **Data Flow & Communication**
| **Interaction**      | **Description** |
|----------------------|----------------|
| **Frontend → Backend** | Uses REST APIs to save user and game state information to the server. |
| **Backend → Database** | Queries PostgreSQL to fetch/store user progress, game state, and AI-generated content. |
| **Backend → Frontend** | Sends game updates via WebSockets and API responses for real-time feedback. |


### Technology Stack & Justification

#### **Frontend:**
- **Svelte**: Chosen for its lightweight and highly reactive nature. Unlike React or Vue, Svelte compiles components into highly efficient vanilla JavaScript, reducing runtime overhead and improving performance. This is beneficial for a game where responsiveness and smooth UI interactions are critical.
- **Phaser.js**: A powerful 2D game framework that integrates well with web technologies. Phaser allows us to implement animations, physics, and game logic efficiently. Its **HTML5 WebGL** support ensures smooth rendering, even in browser-based applications.


#### **Backend:**
- **Go (Gin Framework)**:
  - **Performance:** Go is known for its fast execution and low memory usage, making it ideal for handling game logic and player interactions efficiently.
  - **Scalability:** The Gin framework is a lightweight and high-performance HTTP framework that allows building APIs with minimal boilerplate code.
- **JWT Authentication**:
  - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) provide a **stateless** authentication mechanism, reducing server load compared to traditional session-based authentication.
  - Ensures secure user authentication for saved progress and player-specific game states.
- **Redis (for caching)**:
  - Redis can cache **frequently accessed game data**, such as procedural-generated levels, reducing repeated database queries and improving response times.
  - It can also be used for rate limiting and **session storage**, preventing abuse of AI features.

#### **Database:**
- **PostgreSQL**:
  - **Relational Database**: PostgreSQL’s structured schema ensures consistency and integrity in storing game state, player data, and AI-generated content.
  - **JSONB Support**: Allows storage of dynamically generated AI content (e.g., procedurally generated storylines, levels, or NPC data) in a flexible format.
  - **ACID Compliance**: Ensures game data is **reliable and durable**, preventing data corruption in case of server crashes.

#### **AI & Procedural Generation:**
- **Procedural Generation**:
  - **Levels, enemies, and items** will be generated dynamically using LLMs to keep the gameplay experience fresh.
  - AI-based procedural logic can create unique dungeon layouts, challenges, and randomized loot.
- **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**:
  - AI-generated dialogue and narratives will make NPC interactions more engaging.
  - Ensures **dynamic storytelling**, allowing the player's choices to influence the game world.

### Why This Architecture?

This architecture ensures:
- **Performance**: Efficient rendering with **Svelte & Phaser**, and a fast backend with **Go & Gin**.
- **Scalability**: WebSockets and Go’s concurrency model allow real-time turn-based interactions without performance issues.
- **Security**: JWT authentication and PostgreSQL’s ACID compliance ensure **secure data handling**.
- **Extensibility**: AI-driven procedural generation ensures **endless replayability** without manual content creation.
- **Cross-Platform Playability**: As a web-based game, it is accessible across different devices with no need for downloads.

## **4. Modules and Components (Internal Interfaces)**

### **Module Overview**

The backend is responsible for handling **game logic, player interactions, authentication (OAuth), AI-generated content, and database management**. Below is a breakdown of the key modules, their responsibilities, and how they interact within the **Go (Gin) backend**.

#### **Key Backend Modules & Responsibilities**

| **Module**             | **Technology**            | **Responsibilities** |
|------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------|
| **Authentication**     | OAuth (OAuth2), Gin, PostgreSQL | - Manages **OAuth-based login and user sessions**. <br> - Supports **third-party authentication providers** (Google, GitHub, etc.). <br> - Stores **user profiles and access tokens securely**. |
| **Game State Manager** | Go (Gin), PostgreSQL     | - Manages **player progress, stats, inventory, and world data**. <br> - Ensures **persistent game state** across sessions. <br> - Handles **save/load mechanics** in **PostgreSQL**. |
| **AI Integration**     | Python (LangChain, Groq API) | - Sends **requests to the AI agent** for procedural generation and dynamic content. <br> - Retrieves **AI-generated NPC behaviors, enemy strategies, and dialogue**. <br> - Uses **Command line to communicate with the AI agent** |
| **Procedural Generation** | Python (via AI Agent)  | - Uses AI to generate **dynamic world elements, enemies, and items**. <br> - Adjusts world interactions dynamically based on **player actions**. |
| **Logging & Analytics** | Go (Gin), PostgreSQL, Redis | - Tracks **player actions, combat events, and AI interactions**. <br> - Uses **Redis for caching frequently accessed data**. <br> - Stores analytical data in **PostgreSQL** for game balancing. |
| **API Gateway**        | Go (Gin)                 | - Exposes **REST API endpoints** for the frontend. <br> - Manages **request routing between game modules and AI integration**. <br> - Handles **rate-limiting and error management**. |

### **Component Interaction**

#### **1. Authentication Flow (OAuth)**
1. The user initiates **OAuth login** or Login via the frontend.
2. The frontend redirects to the **OAuth provider (Google, GitHub, etc.)** or creates account.
3. The provider **authenticates the user and returns an access token**.
4. The backend verifies the **token**, retrieves user details, and creates a **session**.
5. The user is now authenticated, and the token is used for **subsequent API requests**.


#### **2. AI Integration Flow**
1. The backend **requests AI-generated content** (e.g., enemy behaviors, NPC dialogue).
2. The **Python-based AI agent (Ollama + Groq API)** processes the request.
3. The **AI-generated response** is returned to the backend, which updates the game world accordingly.

#### **3. Procedural Content Flow**
1. The backend requests **procedural world generation** from the AI.
2. The AI agent **creates and returns world layouts, NPCs, and items**.
3. The backend **stores and serves** this content as needed.
